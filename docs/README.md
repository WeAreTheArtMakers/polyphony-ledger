# Polyphony Ledger Documentation

Public documentation is organized by language.

## Language Folders

- [English](./en/README.md)
- [Turkce](./tr/README.md)

## Scope

These folders contain product-facing material only:

- platform overview and vision
- feature set and architecture highlights
- package structure and deployment options
- governance, observability, and readiness details

Internal strategy notes are intentionally kept local and excluded from Git.
